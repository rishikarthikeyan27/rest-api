So what I am trying to do here is to note down the most important stuff that I need to remember later on:

1) Express helps us add routes very easily
2) Before adding routes we need to listen
3) Nodemon is for node.js to restart the server with every new change automatically
4) Mongoose is what we are going to use to connect to our mongoDB database
5) mongoose.connect('<dbconnection>', {useNewUrlParser: true}, () => console.log('connected to db))
6) dotenv is important for us to hide our passwords and stuff. Please expand your knowledge base on this
7) Here we learnt that to use what we have added in our .env file we need to type it as process.env.<name of the variable in the .env file>
This is done after we have require('dotenv/config')
