So what I am trying to do here is to note down the most important stuff that I need to remember later on:

1) Express helps us add routes very easily

2) Before adding routes we need to listen

3) Nodemon is for node.js to restart the server with every new change automatically

4) Mongoose is what we are going to use to connect to our mongoDB database

5) mongoose.connect('<dbconnection>', {useNewUrlParser: true}, () => console.log('connected to db))

6) dotenv is important for us to hide our passwords and stuff. Please expand your knowledge base on this

7) Here we learnt that to use what we have added in our .env file we need to type it as process.env.<name of the variable in the .env file>
This is done after we have require('dotenv/config')

8) So we create a seperate folder for routes so that we can send a response, and then we connected posts.js to app.js
9) the way we do that is app.use('/',postsRoutes)

const postsRoutes = require('../routes/posts')
10) a function or program that runs between the time from that the server gets 
the request and the time server sends the response to the client.

11) app.use('/',postsRoutes) means the middleware posts.js 
is mounted on '/' path (as in home). This script is executed
for any type of HTTP request on the '/' path.

12) Now we have to understand that nodemon is running app.js
So we need to import post.js in app.js to make the website run.

13) In models we have the "model" for sending and receiving data...

And then we export this model as mongoose.model('<what name you want to export it as>', <the name of the reference to the javascript>)
